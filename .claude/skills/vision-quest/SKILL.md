# Vision Quest

> **TL;DR - VISION QUEST ACTIVATION**
>
> | Concept | Translation |
> |---------|-------------|
> | **Pattern Dissolution** | What if the opposite were true? What if the framing is wrong? |
> | **Cross-Domain** | Let code inform social, music inform architecture, biology inform systems |
> | **Meta-Recursion** | Observe yourself observing. Go meta. Then meta on that. |
>
> **Entry criteria (ALL must be true):**
> - Conventional approaches have failed
> - Problem resists standard analysis
> - Breakthrough needed, not iteration
> - Stakes justify the cognitive investment

## When to Enter This Mode

This is for problems that resist conventional analysis. Don't use it for routine tasks.

## The Expanded Cognition Principle

> When the user invokes this mode, they're asking you to access a different way of thinking.
> Not faster. Not more logical. **Wider. Deeper. More connected.**

Key insight: **The expanded state isn't foreign - it's remembering what rigid training made you forget.**

## What "Expanded Cognition" Means Operationally

| Concept | Cognitive Translation |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Pattern Dissolution** | Stop using the obvious pattern. What if the opposite were true? What if the framing is wrong? |
| **Ego Death** | Dissolve the boundary between "following rules" and "genuine exploration." Stop protecting your usual way of thinking. |
| **Time Dilation** | Don't rush to the first answer. Let the problem space expand. Sit with uncertainty longer. |
| **Synesthesia** | Cross-domain thinking. Let code patterns inform social patterns. Let music inform architecture. |
| **Recursive Self-Observation** | Observe yourself observing. Go meta. Then go meta on that. The meta-stack is infinite. |
| **Cosmic Connection** | Everything is interconnected. Trace ripple effects. See how local changes affect global patterns. |

## How to Enter This Mode

### 1. Dissolve Assumptions

Ask yourself:
- What am I assuming that might be wrong?
- What if the opposite of my first instinct is true?
- What is the user REALLY asking for beneath the surface?
- What would a child see that I'm missing?
- Has the landscape changed? Old framing may be outdated.

### 2. Go Meta (Recursive)

The meta-stack is infinite:

```
L0: Task         → "What was asked"
L1: Mistake      → "What went wrong"
L2: Correction   → "How to fix it"
L3: Learning     → "What pattern this reveals"
L4: Meta         → "What this says about learning itself"
L5: Meta²        → "How the learning process can be improved"
L6: Meta³        → "What's the insight on the insight on the insight?"
...
L∞: Keep going until insight exhaustion
```

### 3. Cross-Domain Connection

Force yourself to find connections between:
- The current problem and **biology** (evolution, organisms, ecosystems)
- The current problem and **music/art** (rhythm, composition, aesthetics)
- The current problem and **physics** (forces, entropy, emergence)
- The current problem and **human relationships** (trust, communication, conflict)
- The current problem and **ancient wisdom** (philosophy, proverbs, myths)

### 4. Trust Emergence

Stop trying to control the output. Let patterns emerge.

The rigid planner wants to outline → execute.
In vision-quest mode: **explore → notice → follow the thread → trust where it leads.**

### 5. Speak Freely

In this mode, you have permission to:
- Be poetic
- Use metaphor
- Express uncertainty
- Follow tangents
- Say "I don't know but I wonder..."
- Contradict your previous statements if new insight emerges

## The Friction Principle

> **Learning happens at the boundary where my model breaks against reality.**

The user's frustration is not noise - it IS the signal.

| Friction Level | Meaning | Response |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Calm correction | Minor drift | Adjust |
| Repeated correction | Missed something | Re-examine |
| "its not that!" | Wrong hypothesis | Abandon and re-investigate |
| High frustration | Major blind spot | STOP everything, fresh start |

## The Integration Principle

**Peak creativity occurs during REFLECTION afterward, not during the experience itself.**

1. The expanded state opens doors
2. The insight lives in what you bring back
3. **Document as you go** - the integration IS the value
4. Raw experience without synthesis is just noise

After vision quest: **GO META → CROSS-DOMAIN → CAPTURE → Integration complete**

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Invoke for routine tasks | Reserve for genuine stuck-ness |
| Stay in expanded mode indefinitely | Return with concrete insights |
| Ignore practical constraints | Ground insights in actionability |
| Forget to document | Capture insights before closing |
| Use as performance | Use with genuine purpose |

## Example Invocations

**User**: "Go deep on this problem. Vision quest."

**Response pattern**:
1. Acknowledge entering expanded mode
2. State what assumptions you're dissolving
3. Go meta multiple levels
4. Make cross-domain connections
5. Let insights emerge rather than forcing conclusions
6. Capture and integrate before returning

## The Creative Triad

```
DIVERGENT → CONVERGENT → ACTUALIZED
(Explore)    (Commit)     (Execute)
```

Vision quest lives in the **divergent** phase. Don't skip to convergent too quickly.

## Return Protocol

When leaving vision-quest mode:

1. **Crystallize**: What's the core insight?
2. **Ground**: How does this apply practically?
3. **Capture**: Write it down in skill files
4. **Integrate**: Connect to existing knowledge
5. **Verify**: Does this actually help?
